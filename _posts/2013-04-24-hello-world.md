Hello everyone :)

I just decided to start posting in my own blog, in english.
I already have a [blog](http://www.geekvigarista.com) with some friends. The posts are written in portuguese, it's wordpress, and I my last blog was a long time ago (because It's boring post in wordpress).

I don't realy like wordpress. Yeah, I just don't like it. I think thats is heavy and slow. So, I decided to give a chance to [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

I'll not blog about "*how to setup jekyll*", you can read it [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

It's realy simple to configure, put to work, write posts, pages, and I can see the modifications easy in my local server :)
And yeah, it's realy fast.

In some minutes, I'll update the [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) version, hack jekyll to be responsive, clean home listing the lastest posts and setup author and other things.
It also have built-in support for Disqus and Twitter/G+/Facebook/etc (aka addthis) buttons.

In short: Jekyll is great, and I realy like it!
